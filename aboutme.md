### ABOUT ME

I always had a strong desire to seek knowledge. Since I was a kid I would watch hundreds of documentaries on varies topics.
I have had an interest in computer science since I was in middle school. I love computers, I love the software and hardware. It
was all very attractive to me. I chose to study Data Science because I wanna be able to apply mathematics and computer science to
the artifical intelligence level. I saw so much knowledgable value in Data Science and so now I am on my way to pursing that goal, which 
is to earn the title of Data Scientist.
